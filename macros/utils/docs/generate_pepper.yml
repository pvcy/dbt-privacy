    description: >
      Generates a value that is suitable as a pepper to increase
      the security of the hash generated by this package. For additionally security,
      set the `DBT_PRIVACY_PEPPER_SEED` environment variable to a random value.
      Defaults to creating a pepper that is long-lived and unique per-model, but this 
      can be configured depending on your needs.
      
      NOTE: The value of DBT_PRIVACY_PEPPER_SEED will be visible in the compiled 
      model code and in query logs. If an attacker has access to the code and the
      data, they will be able to construct a rainbow table for this hash method.

          Defaults to `'model'`. Must be one of (`'model'`, `'target'`, or
          `'project'`). The pepper generated will be unique within the defined scope,
          which means the hash produced for an `expr` will also be unique within the
          defined scope. For example, if you would like to hash an email address field
          and would like a unique email address to have the same digest in multiple
          models, use the `target` scope. If you would like that email address to have
          the same digest in dev and prod, use the `project` scope

          Defaults to `'permanent'`. Must be one of (`'permanent'` or `'ephemeral'`).
          If `ephemeral`, a new pepper will be generated on every run of dbt.
