  - name: mask_email
    description: >
      Splits an email address into its address and domain parts.
      Will `safe_mask` the address and also `safe_mask` the domain, if
      there are fewer than `domain_n` records with that domain.

      Returns `null` if `expr` is `null`, but does not return `null` if `expr`
      is not a valid email address (with no "@").

      Note: Masking unique domains is important for protecting individuals
      with addresses like `personal@famouscelebrity.com`
